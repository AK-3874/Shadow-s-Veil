Shadow’s Veil consists of two unique acts: Act I and Act II, both of which require the player to complete a set of tasks before proceeding to the next act. The main objectives of each act will be presented at the top of the screen, serving as a mini guide for the player during both acts. There will be two separate types of characters: during Act I, the players will assume the role of a security guard posted for night duty in the clinic, while in Act II, they will play as a police officer tasked with uncovering the mysteries of the clinic following the events of Act I. Both characters will be controlled using the "WASD" keys for movement and the space bar for jumping.
In Act I, the player's focus will be on collecting the numerous fuses scattered across the clinic, while in Act II, the focus will shift towards combat and defeating enemies. The police officer (in Act II) will use a UV flashlight as a primary weapon to deal damage to the evil entities present in the clinic during that act.
